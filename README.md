# BonziRogueClean
## Note from future me (January 2021)
Hey. This is just terrible code I made years ago. All I did in this garbage software was replace the swears with lame rhymes, for the one person out there that wanted a clean version. I'm leaving this up, but not because it's good. It's terrible code that I made, back when my stupid self wanted to write for a deprecated toolset, that would eventually break on Windows 10 because of its ancient code when Windows XP was relevant. Enjoy.
## Original README
A PUP software based on the BonziBuddy virtual assistant, but more annoying.
Also, the original has been copied and remade so it is PG.

To build/edit, open BonzVir.msh or BonziRogue.cls in MASH http://bellcraft.com/mash/ end export as an executable, assets are included in Release 1.

Only tested in Windows XP/SP3, should work on newer Windows versions if you have the DoubleAgent framework installed https://sourceforge.net/projects/doubleagent/
