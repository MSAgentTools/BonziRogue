# BonziRogue
A PUP software based on the BonziBuddy virtual assistant, but more annoying.
Also, the original has been copied and remade so there is no swears or adult relations

To build/edit, open BonzVir.msh or BonziRogue.cls in MASH http://bellcraft.com/mash/ end export as an executable, assets are included in Release 1.

Only tested in Windows XP/SP3, should work on newer Windows versions if you have the DoubleAgent framework installed https://sourceforge.net/projects/doubleagent/
